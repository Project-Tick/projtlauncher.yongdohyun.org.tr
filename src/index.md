          <p>ProjT Launcher can help. Each Minecraft instance has its own folder, with completely separate mods, resource packs, and settings for each instance.</p>

          You don't need an embedded web browser as a game launcher. ProjT Launcher uses the Qt toolkit, which requires very few system resources to run.
          ProjT Launcher also lets you customize the menu and supports <a href="https://projtlauncher.yongdohyun.org.tr/wiki/getting-started/change-themes/">custom themes</a>.
